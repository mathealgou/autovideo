### I promise a better name will come.

An application in very early stages. Its supposed to be able to create short, informational videos on topics based on information on the web. It has a lot of dependecies, so I would recommend you check the **requirements.txt** file for more information on what I'm building upon. It doesn't have, and probably will not have (at least for the foreseeable future) a graphical user interface, only a very basic command line one, which, for it's purpose, should be more than enough.

This project was started in **10/02/2022**.
